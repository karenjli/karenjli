# About Me 👋

Hello! Glad to see you here. 

I am a classical pianist turned elementary school teacher turned software engineer.

My stack is primarily JavaScript. I also have experience with cloud based infrastructure. 

Outside of software engineering, you will find me sipping oolong tea and reading history books.
